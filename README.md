# homework-19-progressive-budget

# Description

This was my homework #19 Progressive-Budget. I was tasked with adding a functionality to the existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The primary focus of this application was to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection, and when entering transactions offline, it should populate the total when brought back online.

Throughout this homework, I mainly worked out of the public folder. By creating db.js, index.js, manifest.json, and service-worker.js. Additionally, two big focus of this homework was adding the manifest and service-workers.

After writing the code, I checked it in my localhost url to see if it was working offline and online. After I saw it was working... I deployed my applicatioin to Heroku, which at that point it was not working offline/online. Initially and for the longeset time, I thought I was having issues with Heroku deployment; however, I realized that I forgot to connect my deployed application with MongoDB. After deploying MongoDB my application was working correct.

Please see images for offline and online snapshot of deployed application.
